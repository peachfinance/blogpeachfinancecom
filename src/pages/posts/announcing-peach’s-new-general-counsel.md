We’re excited to announce that [Shara Chang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shara-chang-20b27b16/) has joined [Peach](http://www.peachfinance.com) as our General Counsel & Chief Compliance Officer. 

Shara’s addition will enable us to build and scale our lending and servicing systems with compliance considerations at the forefront. Because one of our main value-adds for lenders is mitigating compliance risk, our own investment in legal and compliance personnel is critically important. Our solutions incorporate federal and state laws in a way that keeps lenders compliant on all fronts while at the same time helping borrowers maintain or improve their financial health. 

Shara brings keen insight into lending regulation, technology, payments and privacy. She previously helped Affirm, Inc. scale its lending products to millions of borrowers while successfully navigating a shifting regulatory landscape. Her exceptional knowledge of lending product functionality will help us build and deliver state-of-the-art solutions that are true innovations never seen before in market.

“Loan servicing has been a priority for federal and state regulators and we should expect an intensified focus in this space, particularly in today’s economic climate where borrowers with financial hardships need flexible repayment options to get by,” Shara said. “Peach’s suite of services feature a sleek servicing platform that unlocks these options for borrowers and automated tools that help lenders navigate the patchwork of federal and state laws impacting their servicing operations. I look forward to leveraging my experience with disruptive tech companies and leading financial institutions to help Peach deliver on its strategic initiatives and modernize the loan servicing industry.”

We couldn’t be more excited to welcome Shara to the Peach team!
